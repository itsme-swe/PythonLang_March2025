"""
ðŸ”¸ Here, we are acheiving polymorphism by method overloading. ' sum() ' function is performing calculation upon two parameters as well as for 3 parameters differently.

In python if we create one function with different parameters the last function over shadowed other functions automatically, but in C++ and java we can create one function with different parametrs.
